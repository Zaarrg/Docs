## üìö **How to use the Bot?**

### Updating Leaderboard

<h3 align="center">Small Disclaimer</h3>

‚ö†Ô∏è **The tournament and team fields in commands are always autofill, discord is sometimes slow u might have to wait**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Also Leaderboard will show the actual rounds like in the game instead of the surpassed, points still are based on surpassed**


<h3 align="center">Kill Race Template Leaderboard Update</h3>

1. The template uses the **1P per kill**, **15P per surpassed round**, **30P per win**.
2. It automatically calculates the surpassed rounds, only **enter whats on submitted screenshot eg. 3/4 => 3 rounds**
3. It automatically **saves all entered games** and **sets the score for the best 3 Games**.
4. For easier use the command has kills1,2,3 for player 1,2,3 so u dont have to add them.

<h3 align="center">Kill Race Direct Leaderboard Update</h3>
1. Updates the score directly. Entering kills: -1 will subtract 1 and kills: 1 add one
2. If u used the template before the score will change based on what the team has currently. If u then use the template again it will use all submitted games instead.
